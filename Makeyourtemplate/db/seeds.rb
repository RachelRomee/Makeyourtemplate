        <h1>Walter White</h1>
        <p>Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher and family man, learns he has inoperable lung cancer. To secure his family's financial future, he begins making meth with Jesse Pinkman, a former student. The two become known for their top-quality blue meth, but success has its complications: Walt finds himself in over his head in the drug underworld. Meanwhile, a DEA team led by Walt's brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, begins investigating Heisenberg, Walt's alter ego.</p>

        <h1>Jesse Pinkman</h1>
        <p>Jesse Pinkman is Walt's former student and partner in the meth business. He was never the brightest student, but has grown to be a skilled meth cook in his own right under Walt's guidance. Jesse initially handled the street part of the operation, though his blunders often required Walt's intervention. </p>
